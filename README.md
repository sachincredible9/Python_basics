# Awesome Production RAG 🚀
A curated list of tools, patterns, and post-mortems for building RAG that actually works in production.

## 📂 Data Ingestion (The Hard Part)
- **RAGFlow**: Deep document understanding (OCR + Layout analysis).
- **LlamaParse**: Specialized parsing for complex financial documents.

## 🧠 Retrieval Strategies
- **Hybrid Search**: Combining BM25 (Keywords) with Vector Search.
- **GraphRAG**: Using Knowledge Graphs for multi-hop reasoning.
- **Rerankers**: FlashRank (Lightweight), BGE-Rerank.

## 🧪 Evaluation & Observability
- **Ragas**: Metrics for Faithfulness, Answer Relevancy.
- **Arize Phoenix**: Tracing and visualizing retrieval steps.
- **Langfuse**: Open source observability for RAG pipelines.

## 🤖 Agentic Patterns
- **Self-RAG**: Tokens that control when to retrieve more data.
- **Adaptive RAG**: Routing queries based on complexity.
